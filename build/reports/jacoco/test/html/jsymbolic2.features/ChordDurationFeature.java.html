/**
 * A feature calculator that finds the average duration a chord in units of time corresponding to the duration
 * of an idealized quarter note. A &quot;chord&quot; here is considered to stay the same as long as no new pitch classes
 * are added, and no pitch classes are taken away. This &quot;chord&quot; may consist of any number of pitch classes,
 * even only one. A &quot;chord&quot; is not considered to end if it is split by one or more rests (although the rests
 * themselves are not counted in the duration of the &quot;chord&quot;).
