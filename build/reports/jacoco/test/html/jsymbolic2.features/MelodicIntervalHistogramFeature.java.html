/**
 * A feature vector consisting of the bin magnitudes of the melodic interval histogram described above. Each
 * bin corresponds to a melodic interval, and the bin index indicates the number of semitones comprising the
 * interval associated with the bin (there are 128 bins in all). For example, bin 0 corresponds to repeated
 * pitches, bin 1 to a melodic interval of one semitone, bin 2 to a melodic interval of 2 semitones, etc. The
 * magnitude of each bin is proportional to the fraction of melodic intervals in the piece that are of the
 * kind associated with the bin (this histogram is normalized). Rising and falling intervals are treated as
 * identical. Melodies are assumed to be contained within individual MIDI tracks and channels, so melodic
 * intervals are found separately for each track and channel before being combined in this histogram. It is
 * also assumed that there is only one melody at a time per MIDI channel (if multiple notes occur
 * simultaneously on the same MIDI tick on the same MIDI track and channel, then all notes but the first note
 * on that tick are ignored). Other than this, all notes on the same track and the same channel are treated as
 * if they are part of a single melody. It is also assumed that melodies do not cross MIDI tracks or channels
 * (i.e. that they are each separately contained in their own track and channel). Only pitched notes are
 * considered, so all notes on the unpitched MIDI Channel 10 are ignored.
