/**
 * A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the vertical interval histogram described in the jSymbolic
 * manual. Each of the bins is associated with a different vertical pitch interval, and is labeled with the
 * number of semitones in that corresponding interval. More specifically, these are numbered from 0 (a unison)
 * to 127 (a vertical interval of 127 semitones). The magnitude of each bin is found by going through a
 * recoding MIDI tick by MIDI tick and noting all vertical intervals that are sounding at each tick, as well
 * as the MIDI velocities of the pair of notes involved in each vertical interval. The end result is a
 * histogram that indicates which vertical intervals are present, and how significant these vertical intervals
 * are relative to one another, with a weighting based on both MIDI velocity and the aggregated durations with
 * which each interval is held throughout the piece. Finally, the histogram is normalized.
