/**
 * A feature extractor that calculates a feature vector consisting of the bin magnitudes of the beat histogram
 * described in the jSymbolic manual. However, the tempo of the music is standardized to 120 BPM throughout
 * the piece before this histogram is calculated. This means that variations in tempo within a single piece
 * are in effect eliminated for the purposes of this histogram. The tempo-independent beat histograms of
 * different pieces can also be compared in a way that is independent of potential tempo differences between
 * the pieces. Rubato and dynamics do still influence the tempo-independent beat histogram, however. Also, the
 * first 40 bins are not included in this feature vector, as is the case with the basic beat histogram. Each
 * bin corresponds to a different beats per minute periodicity, with tempo increasing with the bin index. The
 * magnitude of each bin is proportional to the cumulative loudness (MIDI velocity) of the notes that occur at
 * that bin's rhythmic periodicity. The histogram is normalized.
