/**
 * A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the chord type histogram described in the jSymbolic
 * manual. This is a normalized histogram that has bins labeled with types of chords (in the following order
 * and with the indicated identifying codes): partial chords consisting of just two pitch classes [0], minor
 * triads [1], major triads [2], diminished triads [3], augmented triads [4], other triads [5], minor seventh
 * chords [6], dominant seventh chords [7], major seventh chords [8], other chords consisting of four pitch
 * classes [9], and complex chords with more than four pitch classes [10]. The bin magnitudes are calculated
 * by going through MIDI ticks one by one and incrementing the counter for the bin that corresponds to the
 * chord, if any, that is present during each given tick; the result is that the chords in this histogram are
 * weighted by the duration with which each chord is played. All inversions are treated as equivalent and
 * octave doubling is ignored in the calculation of this histogram. Melodic behaviour is not considered, so
 * arpeggios are not counted in this histogram.
