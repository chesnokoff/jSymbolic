/**
 * A feature calculator that finds the mean offset in duration of notes from the idealized durations of each
 * of their nearest quantized rhythmic values, expressed as a fraction of the duration of an idealized
 * quantized quarter note. Offsets are treated as absolute values, so offsets that are longer or shorter than
 * each idealized duration are both treated as identical positive numbers in this calculation. This feature
 * provides an indication of how consistently quantized note durations are or, expressed slightly differently,
 * how well they conform to idealized note durations. Higher values indicate greater average deviation from
 * idealized note durations. Both pitched and unpitched notes are included, and this is calculated without
 * regard to the dynamics, voice or instrument of any given note.
