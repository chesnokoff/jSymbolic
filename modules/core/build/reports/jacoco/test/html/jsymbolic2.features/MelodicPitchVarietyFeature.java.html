 * before being combined. Notes that occur simultaneously on the same MIDI tick are only counted as one note
 * for the purpose of this calculation. Notes that do not recur after 16 notes in the same channel are not
 * included in this calculation. Set to 0 if there are no qualifying repeated notes in the piece.
