/**

 * all voices, including both pitched and unpitched notes. In order to calculate this, the piece is broken
 * into windows of 8 quarter note duration, and the note density of each window is calculated. The final value
 * of this feature is then found by calculating the standard deviation of the note densities of these windows.
 * Set to 0 if there is insufficient music for more than one window.
