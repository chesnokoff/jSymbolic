/**
 * A feature calculator that finds the fraction fraction of movements between voices that consist of oblique
 * motion (the fraction is calculated relative to the total amount of qualifying transitions, including all
 * parallel, similar, contrary and oblique transitions). If more than two voices are involved in a given pitch
 * transition, then each possible pair of voices comprising the transition is included in the calculation.
 * Note that only transitions from one set of pitches to another set of pitches comprising the same number of
 * pitches as the first are included in this calculation, although a brief lookahead is performed in order to
 * accommodate small rhythmic desynchronizations (e.g. if a MIDI file is a transcription of a human
 * performance). Only unique pitches are included in this calculation (unisons are treated as a single pitch).
 * All pitches present are considered, regardless of their MIDI channel or track; this has the advantage of
 * accommodating polyphonic instruments such as piano or guitar, but the consequence is that this feature does
 * not incorporate an awareness of voice crossing.
