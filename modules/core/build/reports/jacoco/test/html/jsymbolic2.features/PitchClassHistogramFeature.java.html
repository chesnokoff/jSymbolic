/**
 * A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the pitch class histogram described in the jSymbolic
 * manual. Each bin corresponds to one of the 12 pitch classes, ordered in increasing pitch with an interval
 * of a semitone between each (enharmonic equivalents are assigned the same pitch class number). The first bin
 * corresponds to the most common pitch class in the piece under consideration (it does NOT correspond to a
 * set pitch class). The magnitude of of each bin is proportional to the the number of times notes occurred at
 * the bin's pitch class in the piece, relative to all other pitch classes in the piece (the histogram is
 * normalized).
