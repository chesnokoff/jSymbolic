/**
 * A feature extractor that calculates a normalized feature vector that indicates, for each rhythmic value,
 * the normalized median number of times that notes with that rhythmic value occur consecutively (either
 * vertically or horizontally) in the same voice (MIDI channel and track). Each bin corresponds to a different
 * rhythmic value, and they are numbered as follows: thirty second notes (or less) [0], sixteenth notes [1],
 * eighth notes [2], dotted eighth notes [3], quarter notes [4], dotted quarter notes [5], half notes [6],
 * dotted half notes [7], whole notes [8], dotted whole notes [9], double whole notes [10] and dotted double
 * whole notes (or more ) [11]. Both pitched and unpitched notes are included in this histogram. Tempo is, of
 * course, not relevant to this histogram. Notes with durations not precisely matching one of these rhythmic
 * note values are mapped to the closest note value (to filter out the effects of rubato or uneven human
 * rhythmic performances, for example). This histogram is calculated without regard to dynamics.
