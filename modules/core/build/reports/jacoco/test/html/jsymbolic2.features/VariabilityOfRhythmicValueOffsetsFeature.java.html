/**
 * A feature calculator that finds the standard deviation of the offsets of note durations of notes from the
 * idealized durations of each of their nearest quantized rhythmic values, expressed as a fraction of the
 * duration of an idealized quantized quarter note. Offsets are treated as absolute values, so offsets that
 * are longer or shorter than each idealized duration are both treated as identical positive numbers in this
 * calculation. This feature provides an indication of how much these offsets vary or, expressed slightly
 * differently, how rhythmically consistent note durations are. A higher value indicates greater variety in
 * offsets between different notes. Both pitched and unpitched notes are included, and this is calculated
 * without regard to the dynamics, voice or instrument of any given note.
