/**
 * A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the wrapped vertical interval histogram described in the
 * jSymbolic manual. Each of the bins is associated with a different vertical pitch interval, and is labeled
 * with the number of semitones in that corresponding interval. More specifically, these are numbered from 0
 * (a unison) to 11 (a vertical interval of 11 semitones). The magnitude of each bin is found by going through
 * a recoding MIDI tick by MIDI tick and noting all vertical intervals that are sounding at each tick, as well
 * as the MIDI velocities of the pair of notes involved in each vertical interval. Intervals larger than 11
 * semitones are wrapped (e.g. an octave (12 semitones) is added to the bin for unisons (0 semitones)). The
 * end result is a histogram that indicates which vertical intervals are present, and how significant these
 * vertical intervals are relative to one another, with a weighting based on both MIDI velocity and the
 * aggregated durations with which each interval is held throughout the piece. Finally, the histogram is
 * normalized.
